## About Linkat
- Linkat is being developed purely as a hobby by an individual, [@mkizka.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/mkizka.dev) (hereafter referred to as the developer).
- There is a possibility that the service might suddenly disappear due to reasons like inability to pay for server costs.
  - However, users' data is stored in their own PDS, so the service can be restored if the program is copied.
  - The program is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mkizka/linkat). Please give it a star!
- While we handle authentication information with care, we sincerely apologize if any inconvenience occurs.
  - If you're concerned, feel free to contact us, and we will manually delete your registered authentication information.

## Content Creation
- Please ensure that the links and texts posted on the board do not cause trouble for others.
  - The developer may hide the page at their discretion.
  - The service will be immediately terminated if any unsolvable issues arise.
  - If you encounter any problems, please contact us via DM on Bluesky.

## Access Analytics
- Linkat uses the [umami](https://umami.is) access analytics tool to monitor which pages are viewed and how often.
- Some of the actions and pages viewed are sent to an external server managed by the developer.
- This is purely for the developer to enjoy seeing the number of visits, and this information will never be shared with third parties.
- If you're concerned, you can either stop using the service or use an ad-blocking tool to block communication to the following domain:
  - `umami.mkizka.dev`
